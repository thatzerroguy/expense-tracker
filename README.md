## REAL WORLD USE CASES
Imagine David, who wants to gain better control over his finances. David signs up for an account on the expense tracker app and starts logging his daily expenses, such as coffee, groceries, and transportation. He categorizes his spending, sets a monthly budget for food and entertainment, and logs his income to track his overall balance.

Throughout the month, David monitors his spending with the help of visual graphs and receives notifications when he’s approaching his food budget limit. He also sets a savings goal to save $1,000 for a vacation. Each week, the app shows him how much he has saved and encourages him to stay on track.

At the end of the month, David generates a detailed report of his spending and exports it to review with his financial advisor.
